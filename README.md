# The McGill Billboard Project

Thank you for your interest in the McGill Billboard annotations! This is an unofficial GitHub repository of the McGill Billboard Project. 
We proudly present to you an updated version of the McGill Billboard dataset, consisting of 2 major changes:

* Added the AcousticBrainz features.
* Replaced the Echonest features with the new Spotify analyses.

Quoted from the official McGill Billboard website:
