# The McGill Billboard Project

Thank you for your interest in the McGill Billboard annotations! We are proud to announce a 2.0 release, with many improvements over the original, including new annotations, a number of corrections to errors in the existing annotations, and more accurate estimates of timing.

In order to facilitate the best possible use of these data in the future, we have made them available legally under a CC0 license, but we ask that users follow scholarly norms in any public-facing work based on upon these data by citing the following ISMIR paper:
